	abstract = {Recent developments in the application of line-transect models to aerial surveys have used double-observer sampling to account for undercounting on the transect line, a crucial step in obtaining correct population estimates. This  method is commonly called the mark–recapture line-transect sampling method and estimates the detection probability at zero distance to correct line-transect estimates of abundance. An alternative approach, which uses the same methodology during data collection, is to use a range of covariates, including distance from the transect, in a mark–recapture model. This approach overcomes the implicit assumption of uniform distribution of distances in line-transect estimators. In this paper, we use three alternative approaches (a multiple-covariates distance method, a distance method incorporating adjustment for incomplete detection on the transect line using mark–recapture sampling, and a mark–recapture method with distance as a covariate) to estimate the abundance of several medium-sized mammals in semiarid ecosystems. Densities determined with the three estimators varied considerably within species and sites. In some cases distance estimates were larger than mark–recapture estimates and vice versa. Despite large numbers of observations, distance uniformity was not observed for any species at any site, nor for any species where sites were combined. Possible reasons, which include sampling variability, movement in response to the aircraft and failure of the mark–recapture independence assumption, are discussed in detail.},

Grevy's zebra foals exhibit longer intervals between suckling bouts, do not drink water until they are 3 months old, and reach independence from the mare sooner than other equids. Furthermore, Grevy's zebra foals advance their acquisition of adult feeding behaviour. A 6-week-old Grevy's zebra foal spends as much time feeding as a 5-month-old wild horse foal. From the time their foals are born until the foals reach an age of 3 months, females form small groups (three females and their foals). These groups are never found further than 2·0 km from surface water and are usually associated with a territorial male. Unlike other equids, the foals of which always follow their mares, when female Grevy's zebra go to drink, they leave their foals in ‘kindergartens’, which are guarded by a single adult animal, usually a territorial male. It is proposed that many of these differences in behaviour and rates of juvenile development are the result of adaptation to an arid environment. Water requirements during early lactation appear to influence strongly the social behaviour of the Grevy's zebra and should also be a strong influence on the mother-infant behaviour of other arid-living ungulates.},

	abstract = {This paper presents conceptual models of how density dependence and regulation operates in populations. Limitation is a process which sets the potential equilibrium level, and is caused by all forms of mortality or reproductive loss. Random variations in these mortalities will cause the population to fluctuate about the equilibrium. Regulation is the tendency of the population to return, through density dependent factors, to the equilibrium level when disturbed from it. The strength of density dependence determines whether a stable equilibrium, limit cycle or chaotic behaviour occurs. A population rarely, if ever, remains at its equilibrium because of disturbances. Because the amplitude of population fluctuations is determined by both the strength of density dependence and the size of the density independent mortalities, knowledge of both are required to understand population dynamics. Compensation is the ability of a mortality factor to counteract the effects of another one and requires a change in strength of the density dependence. Exact compensation rarely, if ever, occurs. Predators can act in a density dependent way to hold prey numbers at low levels. They can also act in an inverse density dependent (depensatory) way, which at high prey densities limits but not regulates the prey, but at low densities may cause the extinction of prey. Predation can produce special cases of multiple stable states and stable limit cycles. We discuss some of the criticisms of density dependence.},

	abstract = {During 1980 and 1981 population experiments were performed with two two-species guilds of Anolis lizards: A. gingivinus and A. wattsi pogus on the island of St. Maarten (Netherlands Antilles) and A. bimaculatus and A. wattsi schwartzi on the island of St. Eustatius (Netherlands Antilles). These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the strength of interspecific competition is inversely related to the degree of interspecific resource partitioning. The experimental design consisted of four field-enclosures (12 x 12 m) on St. Maarten and four on St. Eustatius. On each island two enclosures contained only the larger native species (A. gingivinus or A. bimaculatus), and two contained both native species. Resource partitioning was measured inside each of the two-species enclosures. There was more interspecific partitioning of space and prey (arthropods) on St. Eustatius than on St. Maarten. A comparison of the one- and two-species enclosures on St. Maarten revealed five competitive effects of A. wattsi pogus on A. gingivinus. In the presence of A. wattsi pogus, A. gingivinus individuals had lower growth rates and increased perch heights. Also, dissected A. gingivinus from the two-species enclosures contained smaller volumes of developing eggs per female, smaller volumes of insect prey per lizard, and smaller mean prey sizes than A. gingivinus from the single-species enclosures. In contrast, no consistent and significant competitive effects of A. wattsi schwartzi on A. bimaculatus were observed on St. Eustatius. These results support a central assumption of competition theory: the strength of interspecific competition increases as the amount of interspecific resource partitioning decreases.},

	abstract = {The impacts of ungulates on small mammals in an East African savanna habitat were investigated by monitoring the population and community responses of small mammals on replicated 4-ha plots from which ungulates had been excluded. The dominant small mammal in this habitat is the pouched mouse, Saccostomus mearnsi, a medium-sized murid rodent. Eight other small mammal species, including Arvicanthis sp., Mus sp., Mastomys sp., Dendromus sp., Crocidura sp., and, rarely, Tatera sp., Aethomys sp., and Acomys sp., were also captured. The dominant ungulates are elephant (Loxodonta africana), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), Grevy's and common zebra (Equus grevyi and E. burchelli), buffalo (Syncerus cafer), eland (Taurotragus oryx), Grant's gazelle (Gazella granti), and domestic cattle. Within 1 year, S. mearnsi populations had responded dramatically to the exclusion of large mammals by a two-fold increase in density, a difference that was maintained through pronounced seasonal fluctuations in the second year. Though individual pouched mice showed no significant differences in their use of space with and without ungulates, male S. mearnsi maintained significantly higher body weights in the absence of ungulates, indicating that habitat quality had increased. One other species, Mastomys sp., also increased in the absence of ungulates. Overall, the small mammal community maintained relatively constant species diversity on the plots to which ungulates did not have access. On the plots to which ungulates did have access, on the other hand, there was a rapid 75\% decrease in diversity in the control plots during one trapping session. Ungulates are most likely affecting small mammals through their effects on food quality, since there were no detectable differences in their exposure to predators, as determined by vegetative cover, in the absence of ungulates. These results demonstrate that ungulates can have strong and rapid impacts on small mammal abundance and diversity in East African savannas, an interaction which has not previously been given serious consideration.},

We developed a method of simultaneous double-counts using tandem observers counting groups of animals in the same transect. Observers overlooked 12.8-43.8\% of the groups of visible animals in their field of view. The mean probability of seeing a solitary animal was 0.66 and 0.91 for a group of 8. Observed group size increased with height, interpreted as a declining probability of seeing small groups with increasing height. The chances of seeing a group appear to be influenced more by the number of its members than member size. We compared the method with the logically equivalent model of Cook and Jacobson (1979). Both are simple to apply with potential for investigating the causes of observer bias or as practical alternatives to conventional aerial survey methods.},

Here the application of bootstrap techniques to mark-recapture models is discussed. The approach also allows generation of robust confidence intervals, which extend beyond the permissible parameter range only if the mark-recapture model itself allows out-of-range parameter estimates. If an animal population is assumed to be closed (i.e., no death, birth, or migration), two further methods of obtaining confidence limits for population size are suggested. The first is based on a Robbins-Monro search for each limit, and the second applies the concept of a randomisation or permutation test. In the absence of nuisance parameters, both methods are exact apart from Monte Carlo variation and the limitations imposed by a discrete distribution. For the second, if all possible permutations are enumerated, Monte Carlo variation is eliminated.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread practical success of deep learning methods, our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks remains quite sparse. We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data, unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions, while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special regime known as the edge of chaos.},

	abstract = {Abstract Most of African's wildlife lives on landscapes inhabited by people. Nowhere is this more evident than on grasslands and savannas of arid areas where conflict between wildlife and livestock has always been common. In the past, economic development on these landscapes has eclipsed conservation, but in today's Africa, where pastoral herders and small-scale landholders seek enhanced lifestyles, understanding the links between behavior and ecology suggests that the demise of wildlife is not inevitable. Behavioral ecology offers insights into how features of the environment shape behavior. By unraveling the rules for particular species in particular environmental circumstances, it is possible to intervene and adjust peoples' behavior so that landscapes can be modified in ways that allow species to sustain themselves while improving human welfare. In this chapter I examine the socioecology of two zebra species—one thriving, the other verging on extinction–and show how resiliency emerges from understanding the link between a species' ecology and its behavior, demography, and population dynamics. I show that by working with large-scale commercial livestock ranchers, small-scale ranchers, and pastoral communities to apply basic behavioral ecological principles in context specific ways, balancing conservation and development is possible.},

Also included is a theorem showing that any L/sub 2/ function from (0, 1)/sup n/ to R/sup m/ can be implemented to any desired degree of accuracy with a three-layer backpropagation neural network.

	abstract = {We present a method for the detection of instances of an object class, such as cars or pedestrians, in natural images. Similarly to some previous works, this is accomplished via generalized Hough transform, where the detections of individual object parts cast probabilistic votes for possible locations of the centroid of the whole object; the detection hypotheses then correspond to the maxima of the Hough image that accumulates the votes from all parts. However, whereas the previous methods detect object parts using generative codebooks of part appearances, we take a more discriminative approach to object part detection. Towards this end, we train a class-specific Hough forest, which is a random forest that directly maps the image patch appearance to the probabilistic vote about the possible location of the object centroid. We demonstrate that Hough forests improve the results of the Hough-transform object detection significantly and achieve state-of-the-art performance for several classes and datasets.},

	abstract = {Recently, pre-trained deep neural networks ({DNNs}) have outperformed traditional acoustic models based on Gaussian mixture models ({GMMs}) on a variety of large vocabulary speech recognition benchmarks. Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random “dropout” procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit ({ReLU}) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modified deep neural networks using {ReLUs} trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2\% relative improvement over a {DNN} trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4\% relative improvement over a strong {GMM}/{HMM} system.

It is not species specific and has been applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or “hotspots”. The first tests each new query image sequentially against each database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images, producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query image in just a few seconds.},

These advances have been motivated by and related to the optimization issues surrounding deep learning. Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful in what they can in principle represent in terms of modeling sequences, their training is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of long-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping gradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and encouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment. The experiments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined effects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test error.},

	abstract = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of {NumPy}’s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics {NumPy}’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates them into C++ (or {CUDA} for {GPU}), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, {NumPy}/{SciPy} and {MATLAB}) when compiled for the {CPU} and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the {GPU}. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both {CPU} and {GPU} processors, and explains its overall design.},
